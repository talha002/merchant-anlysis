# Merchant Analysis

I've made merchant and order analysis with using a data set tried to answer questions down below:

## Analysis Questions

- Review and clean data if necessary
- What characteristics do the most successful merchants share?
- What are the top two shipping carriers? Why should or shouldnâ€™t we try to use those two for all orders?
- Print Providers control the print quality, stock of items, and production time (the time from ordered to fulfilled). We want to provide a discount to the two best Print Providers and end our contracts with the worst two. Which do you choose and why?
